The repo contains the examples shown at the Programming Paradigms lecture.

To run c03-v01.hs you need to install:
  - gnuplot (a plotting app)
  - EasyPlot https://hub.darcs.net/scravy/easyplot (a small library which helps running gnuplot commands from Haskell)
  
To install EasyPlot you can run ''cabal install easyplot''. Cabal is a app designed for installing Haskell libraries, very similar in spirit to ''apt-get''.
